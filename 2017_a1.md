## Question
```
Let S be the smallest set of positive integers such that:
a) 2 is in S,
b) n is in S whenever n^2 is in S, and
c) (n+5)^2 is in S whenever n is in S.
Which positive integers are not in S?
```

## Answer
```
2 is in S. By b), 4 is in S, and 4^2 is in S -- that is, 2, 4, 16. 

a, a^2, a^4, (a^4)^2, ((a^4)^2)^2 ..etc are in S.

S contains a, a^2, a^4, a^8, a^16.
